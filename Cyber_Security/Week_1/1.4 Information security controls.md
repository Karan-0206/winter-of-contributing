<h2 align ="center">What is Information Security Controls?</h2>

Information security controls are countermeasures taken to reduce the risks that are related to information security. The measures are implemented to guard various forms of data and infrastructure of a particular organization. It helps reduce the chances of threats that will exploit any vulnerability present. The work of moderating the risks can also be called 'Risk Mitigation'.

Some examples of security risks are system breaches, Theft of data, Changes to digital information without authorization, etc.

<h2 align ="center">Types of Information Security Controls</h2>

Classification of Information Security Controls can be done by several criteria, but some basic security controls fall into three major categories.

### ***1) Preventive Controls***
 These types of controls are performed before any cybersecurity incident takes place. These types of controls are addresses the weaknesses present in the information systems identified by the risk management team.
 
### ***2) Detective Controls***
 These types of controls are performed by the cybersecurity staff where they begin to limit the damage. These type of controls first alerts the organization to any type of cybersecurity breaches and also warn during the progress of any data breach.
 
### ***3) Corrective Controls***
 These type of controls are performed to help minimize the data loss and the damage occurred on the information systems. Corrective controls can be something such as backups that are used after any cybersecurity incident which helps to restore the information systems as quickly as possible.
 
The actual security controls are categorised in the following types.

### ***1) Physical Accesss Controls***
 These are the type of controls that restricts any type of unauthorized physical access. Some of the examples of Physical Access Controls are protecting the data centres with perimeter fencing, locks, security guards, biometric access systems, etc.

### ***2) Technical Controls***
 Some of the common technical controls are MFA user authentication at login, firewalls, antivirus software, etc.
 
### ***3) Procedural Controls***
 Some of the common technical controls include Education and Training about security awareness, Incident Response plans, etc.
 
### ***4) Compliance Controls***
 These types of controls include frameworks and standards that are structured to reduce security risks. It also includes adherence to privacy laws.
 
 
<h2 align ="center">Security Control Frameworks</h2>

Security Control Frameworks helps enabling any organization to take care of the security controls across various different assets as per widely accepted and tested methodologies. Some of the widely known best frameworks are mentioned below.

  **1) National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework**
  
  **2) Center for Internet Security controls**
